# Currency-Exchange-Website

This is a Currency Exchange website I made using HTML, CSS, and, Javascript.

The website's purpose is to allow a user to exchange/convert between different currencies that are found around the world to help with financial transactions. 

How to use the website?
=======================
To use the currency exchange, the user can simply select their desired currency via a comprehensive list and then input the amount they wish to compare against another currency (e.g., USD 1$ vs. AED 3.67DH).

If the user clicks on the 'swap' button, then the currency type will switch positions however the amount will remain the same but be in that type of currency before the swap (e.g., AED 1DH vs. USD 0.27$).

How does the website operate?
=============================
- HTML structures the page using only a few divs
- CSS designs and moves elements on the page to make it flexible with browsers/devices and make the page visually pleasing
- Javascript works by first defining an index array of currencies, then adding options to the 'currency select' divs and setting the default to USD, then 
  forming a function to help calculate the currency exchange fetching data from a currency exchange, and finally, the event listeners listen for 4 specific events that can triggered.
